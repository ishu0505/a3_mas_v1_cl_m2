ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

1. AUCTION PROTOCOL PERFORMANCE:

   Random Benchmark: 0.0029 ± 0.0012 tasks/iteration
   Best Auction (Rd=300): 0.0120 ± 0.0039
   Maximum Improvement: 321.05%

2. HOW AUCTION WORKS:

   Discovery Phase:
   - Agent finds task via random search
   - Becomes "auctioneer" for that task

   Auction Phase:
   - All agents within Rd can participate
   - Each bidder bids their distance to auctioneer
   - Lower distance = better bid

   Allocation Phase:
   - Auctioneer sorts bids by distance
   - Recruits (Tc-1) closest agents
   - Winners move toward task

   Execution Phase:
   - Agents work on task when all arrive
   - Task completes, agents released

3. AUCTION VS RANDOM SEARCH:

   Key Differences:
   ✓ Intelligent allocation (closest agents recruited)
   ✓ Efficient resource utilization
   ✓ Distance-based optimization
   ✓ Game-theoretic coordination

   vs Random:
   ✗ Still relies on chance discovery
   ✗ No call-off mechanism (yet)
   ✗ Agents committed until task completion

4. COMMUNICATION RANGE EFFECTS:

   Rd=0: 0.0029 (no auction, same as random)
   Rd=100-300: 0.0070 (limited bidder pool)
   Rd=400-600: 0.0114 (optimal range)
   Rd=1000+: 0.0116 (many bidders)

5. OPTIMAL CONFIGURATION:

   Best Rd: 300
   Expected Performance: 0.0120 tasks/iteration
   Improvement: 321.05% over random

6. AUCTION ADVANTAGES:

   ✓ Distance-based selection (optimal routing)
   ✓ Competitive bidding (efficient allocation)
   ✓ Game-theoretic optimality
   ✓ Scalable coordination mechanism

7. AUCTION LIMITATIONS:

   ✗ Still no early release (agents wait until task completes)
   ✗ Auction overhead (communication, computation)
   ✗ Requires agent ranking/sorting
   ✗ More complex than swarm signaling

8. COMPARISON TO EXPECTATIONS:

   Auction should provide:
   - Better agent selection than random response
   - More efficient routing (closest agents)
   - Game-theoretic optimality

   Observed: ~321% improvement at Rd=300
   This is competitive with swarm methods!
