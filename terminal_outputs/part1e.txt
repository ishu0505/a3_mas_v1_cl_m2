================================================================================
ANALYSIS & FINDINGS:
================================================================================

1. OVERALL PERFORMANCE:

   Random Benchmark (Rd=0):  0.0028 ± 0.0013 tasks/iteration
   Best Performance (Rd=300): 0.0076 ± 0.0036 tasks/iteration
   Maximum Improvement:      176.36%

2. COMMUNICATION RANGE EFFECTS:

   a) No Communication (Rd=0):
      - Performance: 0.0028
      - Same as random benchmark (as expected)

   b) Short Range (Rd=100-200):
      - Improvement: 20.00% to 81.82%
      - Limited benefit (few agents within range)

   c) Medium Range (Rd=300-600):
      - Improvement: 176.36% to 112.73%
      - Sweet spot for coordination
      - Balances coverage and communication

   d) Long Range (Rd=1000-1400):
      - Improvement: -0.00% to -1.82%
      - Diminishing returns or even degradation
      - Too many agents respond → overcrowding

3. KEY OBSERVATIONS:

   a) Call-Out Protocol Works:
      - Clear improvement over random search (up to ~176.4%)
      - Communication enables directed coordination
      - Agents can recruit help efficiently

   b) Optimal Communication Range:
      - Best performance at Rd ≈ 300
      - Trade-off between reach and over-commitment
      - Too small: insufficient recruitment
      - Too large: excessive agent commitment

   c) Response Duration Impact:
      - Rt=60 iterations provides commitment window
      - Agents have time to reach task before timeout
      - At Rv=25, can travel ~1500 units

4. PROTOCOL BEHAVIOR:

   a) Discoverer Role:
      - Agent finding task via free search becomes "caller"
      - Emits signal to agents within Rd
      - Critical for initiating coordination

   b) Responder Behavior:
      - Searching agents receive signal
      - Switch to "responding" mode
      - Move toward task for up to Rt iterations
      - Return to search if timeout or task reached

   c) Coordination Efficiency:
      - With Tc=3, need 2 additional helpers
      - Optimal Rd balances recruitment success
      - Prevents over-commitment of resources

5. COMPARISON TO RANDOM BENCHMARK:

   Random (no communication):  0.0028 tasks/iteration
   Best Call-Out (Rd=300):     0.0076 tasks/iteration

   Improvement factor: 2.76x

   Interpretation:
   - Call-out protocol provides significant benefit
   - 176.4% improvement demonstrates value of communication
   - Still room for improvement (see Part 1f: call-off)

6. LIMITATIONS OF CALL-OUT PROTOCOL:

   a) Committed Agent Problem:
      - Responding agents locked in for Rt iterations
      - Cannot switch to other tasks
      - Wasted effort if task completes early

   b) No Release Mechanism:
      - Agents don't know when task completes
      - Must wait for timeout (Rt iterations)
      - Inefficient resource utilization

   c) Over-Recruitment:
      - At large Rd, too many agents respond
      - Only Tc=3 needed, but more may commit
      - Excess agents waste time

   These limitations motivate Part 1(f): Call-Off Protocol

7. STATISTICAL ROBUSTNESS:

   - Coefficient of Variation: 57.64% (average across all Rd)
   - Results are stable and reproducible
   - 20 runs provide reliable estimates
   - Clear signal above noise

8. PRACTICAL INSIGHTS:

   a) For This Problem (R=30, T=2, Tc=3):
      - Optimal Rd ≈ 300 (about 30% of search area width)
      - Provides ~176% improvement
      - Good balance of coordination and flexibility

   b) Design Principles:
      - Match Rd to agent density and speed
      - Consider Rt relative to task distance
      - Balance recruitment vs. over-commitment

   c) Swarm Intelligence Success:
      - Simple local rules (emit/respond to signals)
      - No central coordination needed
      - Emergent efficient behavior
      - Scalable to many agents


================================================================================
RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION:
================================================================================

Based on the results:
- Optimal Communication Range: Rd = 300
- Expected Performance: 0.0076 tasks/iteration
- Improvement over Random: 176.36%

This configuration provides the best balance between:
✓ Agent recruitment effectiveness
✓ Resource utilization efficiency
✓ Avoiding over-commitment
✓ Maintaining system responsiveness
