Part 2(c): Cost-Benefit Analysis
================================================================================

Cost Model:
  Strategic Agent (Auctioneer): Cost = 2 units
  Reactive Agent (Helper/Swarm): Cost = 1 unit

Per-Task Costs:
  Auction: 1 strategic + 2 reactive = 2 + 2 = 4 units
  Swarm:   3 reactive = 3 units

Cost ratio: Auction/Swarm = 1.333x

====================================================================================================
COMPREHENSIVE COST-BENEFIT FINDINGS:
====================================================================================================

1. COST STRUCTURE:

   Per-Task Agent Costs:
   - Call-Out:  3 units (3 reactive @ 1 each)
   - Call-Off:  3 units (3 reactive @ 1 each)
   - Auction:   4 units (1 strategic @ 2 + 2 reactive @ 1)

   Cost Premium: Auction is 33.3% more expensive per task

2. RAW PERFORMANCE (Without Cost Adjustment):

   Average Performance:
   - Call-Off: 0.0051 tasks/iteration
   - Auction:  0.0095 tasks/iteration
   - Difference: +86.54% (Auction better)

   Best Performance:
   - Call-Off: 0.0082
   - Auction:  0.0131
   - Winner: Auction

3. COST-ADJUSTED PERFORMANCE:

   Average Cost-Adjusted Performance:
   - Call-Off: 0.0017 tasks/unit-cost
   - Auction:  0.0024 tasks/unit-cost
   - Difference: +39.90% (Auction better)

   Best Cost-Adjusted Performance:
   - Call-Off: 0.0027
   - Auction:  0.0033
   - Winner: Auction

4. COST-BENEFIT VERDICT:

   Raw Performance: Auction provides 86.5% advantage
   Cost-Adjusted:   Auction provides 39.9% advantage

   Cost Impact: Negative

   The 1.3x cost premium is justified

   Recommendation: Use Auction - Cost justified by performance gains

5. DETAILED TRADE-OFF ANALYSIS:

   Factors Favoring Call-Off:
   ✗ Lower cost-adjusted performance
   ✓ Lower per-task cost (3 vs 4 units)
   ✓ Simpler implementation (all agents identical)
   ✓ Easier deployment and maintenance
   ✓ More robust (no specialized agents)

   Factors Favoring Auction:
   ✓ Better raw performance
   ✓ Optimal agent selection (distance-based)
   ✓ Game-theoretic foundation
   ✓ Systematic coordination
   ✗ Higher complexity (1.3x cost)
   ✗ Requires strategic agents

6. WHEN TO CHOOSE EACH PROTOCOL:

   Choose Call-Off when:
   • Cost efficiency is priority
   • System simplicity valued
   • All agents should be equivalent
   • Robust to agent failures needed


   Choose Auction when:
   • Raw performance is critical
   • Optimal allocation needed
   • Strategic agents available
   • Game-theoretic guarantees desired
   • Cost premium acceptable

7. BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS:

   For auction to be cost-effective, need:
   Performance gain > Cost premium

   Required improvement: 33.3%
   Actual improvement: 86.5%

   Break-even: YES - Auction pays for itself

8. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:

   Resource Budget Analysis:
   If budget allows N total agent-units:

   With Call-Off: N/3 = 33 tasks (if 100 units available)
   With Auction:  N/4 = 25 tasks (if 100 units available)

   Throughput difference: 32.0% more tasks with Call-Off

   For equal throughput, Auction needs:
   1.3x more budget than Call-Off

9. FINAL RECOMMENDATION:

   Based on cost-benefit analysis with Tc=3:

   ★★★ AUCTION IS RECOMMENDED ★★★

   Reasoning:
   Auction provides 39.9% better cost-adjusted performance

   The simpler, more cost-effective protocol should be preferred
   unless there are specific requirements for game-theoretic optimality.
